## 👾 Dependencies
If you don't have them already, you need to install some prerequisites:

* [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads)
* [Java 8 JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/pt/java/javase/downloads/index.html)
* [Gradle](https://gradle.org/install)
* [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) (optional)


## 🍹 Gradle
The project comes with some useful tools that will help you automatize some common tasks:

* `gradle clean` to clean up the files generated by the build process
* `gradle build` to build and compile the entire project
* `gradle test` to run unit tests
* `gradle javadoc` to generate the javadoc

## ⏳ Basic Workflow
To start developing you can follow the simple workflow described below.

1. Develop a new feature with unit tests
2. Run `gradle test`
3. If tests fail, fix the code and go back to step 2
4. If you need to add more features, go back to step 1
5. Run `gradle clean build`
6. Open a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/curiosone-bot/curiosone-core/compare)
7. Let others review your code
8. Marge the pull request into the master branch

At the end of this workflow you should have a unit tested version of project that is ready for use.
